                <h3>The Setting</h3>
                <p>The time was early Spring of 1888. The plass was the mountainous terrain of
                  Eastern Kentucky. <br>
                  A 10-year old boy nambed Sam Hurley, poorly clad, was alone in the woods and was about
                  to "bed down" for the evening. Day after day, he had walked from one house to another,
                  searching for woek in exchange fo food to eat. His father had died earlier and there was no income in
                  the Hurley household.
                  The few jars of canned foood in the pantry had been gone for days.
                </p>
                <h3>The Promise </h3>
                <p>Sam found a rock outcropping which he called a cave and kicked the stones around
                  to make a smooth place to lie down. Some half-decayed leaves pulled up arround him provided a blanket
                  of warmth
                  to his shivering body. Then, he was struck with fear: the fierce call of the catamount
                  (mountainlion)... coming closer and closer
                  ... drove him to call to God for help. He prayed for God's protection throughout the night. He told
                  God if he would spare him from the catamount,
                  he would build a place for boys and girls like himself so they wouldn't have to sleep in the woods.
                  <br>
                  Sam did make it through the night ... and through many more. <br>
                  After some very rough beginnings, he became a successful businessman, He never attended school. At the
                  age of 22 he married the love
                  of his life, Jane Looney. Jane taught him how to read and write. Sam was successful and, of course,
                  never gave his
                  promise to God a second thought... until a little boy (much like himself) came into his office in the
                  courthouse in Grundy, Birgini, and asked if Mr. Hurley would take him into his house and heep him
                  because he didn't have anywhere to go.
                  He told the boy he had seven children of his own and had taken in nine others and he did not have room
                  for him.
                </p>
                <h3>Fulfilling the Promise</h3>
                <p>Later that same day when Sam went out of the courthouse to lunch, he noticed the little boy sitting
                  up against the
                  courthouse crying, Then, he remembered his promise. He immediately visited his lawyer who completed
                  the
                  necessary paperwork for starting Grundy Academy, which later became Mountain Industrial Institute ...
                  Which is now Mountain Mission School.
                </p>
                <h3>MMS Today</h3>
                <p>It is estimated that more than 20,000 children have received care at MMS since its founding in 1921.
                  Chris Slone,
                  great-grandson of Sam Hurley, serves as the school's sixth president. <br>
                  The campus first consisted of one building and now contains Hurley Hall for Girls (3 separeate
                  residences),
                  Parker Hall (4 separate residences) and Toddler Hall (for boys and girls under 7 years) plus an
                  educational building.
                  Vocation and fine arts building, campus chapel and administration building. It is much like a small
                  college
                  campus. Typically, 200-230 resident student (ages 18 months to 20 years) reside on campus. <br>
                  A fine private school consisting of grades pre-k through 12 operates on the campus.
                  MMS teachers with advanced degrees teach several college courses to MMS students. There are 40+ staff
                  members. All students
                  from kindergarten through high school are computer literate and all high school students are computer
                  competent. <br>
                  More than 95%of MMS graduates fo on to college!

                          I grew up in family of seven kids in a really bad part of louisville. It was a very hard time
                          for us, especially when my little siter was diagnosed with Slickle Cell Anemia. I don't thik
                          my mom was handling it all well, because she started drinking. My dad was just sad most of
                          the time <br>
                          I kept wondering where God was in al of this. <br>
                          My mom went to rehag and all of us kids were sent to fifferent places. I was put into foster
                          care.
                          Later on throughout my life, God turned my life around. God gave me a chance to go to summer
                          camp. The director knew
                          about MOuntain Mission School and suggested it for me since things were not good back at home.
                          <br>
                          I like it here. I can get all the help I need. I don't have to stress about home. I can focus
                          on my
                          schoolwork. God is good in many ways.

                          prison
                          for doing a very bad thing. We didn't have a lot of food, and my mom said it wasn't safe at
                          home, so she
                          brought me to Mountain Mission school. <br>
                          It is a whole lot better here than I imagined it would be. The food is really
                          good, and I have learned about Jesus and how He watches over me.
                          When I grow up. I want to go to college and then into the Air Force so I can protect people.

                          I grew up in family of seven kids in a really bad part of louisville. It was a very hard time
                          for us, especially when my little siter was diagnosed with Slickle Cell Anemia. I don't thik
                          my mom was handling it all well, because she started drinking. My dad was just sad most of
                          the time <br>
                          I kept wondering where God was in al of this. <br>
                          My mom went to rehag and all of us kids were sent to fifferent places. I was put into foster
                          care.
                          Later on throughout my life, God turned my life around. God gave me a chance to go to summer
                          camp. The director knew
                          about MOuntain Mission School and suggested it for me since things were not good back at home.
                          <br>
                          I like it here. I can get all the help I need. I don't have to stress about home. I can focus
                          on my
                          schoolwork. God is good in many ways.

                          Where I lived wasn't a very safe place. It was just me, my mom, and my sisters. My dad is in
                          prison
                          for doing a very bad thing. We didn't have a lot of food, and my mom said it wasn't safe at
                          home, so she
                          brought me to Mountain Mission school. <br>
                          It is a whole lot better here than I imagined it would be. The food is really
                          good, and I have learned about Jesus and how He watches over me.
                          When I grow up. I want to go to college and then into the Air Force so I can protect people.
                          <br>
                          Right now, I am here at MMS, but that's OK because it is a very beautiul and safe place.
