                <h3>The Setting</h3>
                <p>The time was early Spring of 1888. The plass was the mountainous terrain of
                  Eastern Kentucky. <br>
                  A 10-year old boy nambed Sam Hurley, poorly clad, was alone in the woods and was about
                  to "bed down" for the evening. Day after day, he had walked from one house to another,
                  searching for woek in exchange fo food to eat. His father had died earlier and there was no income in
                  the Hurley household.
                  The few jars of canned foood in the pantry had been gone for days.
                </p>
                <h3>The Promise </h3>
                <p>Sam found a rock outcropping which he called a cave and kicked the stones around
                  to make a smooth place to lie down. Some half-decayed leaves pulled up arround him provided a blanket
                  of warmth
                  to his shivering body. Then, he was struck with fear: the fierce call of the catamount
                  (mountainlion)... coming closer and closer
                  ... drove him to call to God for help. He prayed for God's protection throughout the night. He told
                  God if he would spare him from the catamount,
                  he would build a place for boys and girls like himself so they wouldn't have to sleep in the woods.
                  <br>
                  Sam did make it through the night ... and through many more. <br>
                  After some very rough beginnings, he became a successful businessman, He never attended school. At the
                  age of 22 he married the love
                  of his life, Jane Looney. Jane taught him how to read and write. Sam was successful and, of course,
                  never gave his
                  promise to God a second thought... until a little boy (much like himself) came into his office in the
                  courthouse in Grundy, Birgini, and asked if Mr. Hurley would take him into his house and heep him
                  because he didn't have anywhere to go.
                  He told the boy he had seven children of his own and had taken in nine others and he did not have room
                  for him.
                </p>
                <h3>Fulfilling the Promise</h3>
                <p>Later that same day when Sam went out of the courthouse to lunch, he noticed the little boy sitting
                  up against the
                  courthouse crying, Then, he remembered his promise. He immediately visited his lawyer who completed
                  the
                  necessary paperwork for starting Grundy Academy, which later became Mountain Industrial Institute ...
                  Which is now Mountain Mission School.
                </p>
                <h3>MMS Today</h3>
                <p>It is estimated that more than 20,000 children have received care at MMS since its founding in 1921.
                  Chris Slone,
                  great-grandson of Sam Hurley, serves as the school's sixth president. <br>
                  The campus first consisted of one building and now contains Hurley Hall for Girls (3 separeate
                  residences),
                  Parker Hall (4 separate residences) and Toddler Hall (for boys and girls under 7 years) plus an
                  educational building.
                  Vocation and fine arts building, campus chapel and administration building. It is much like a small
                  college
                  campus. Typically, 200-230 resident student (ages 18 months to 20 years) reside on campus. <br>
                  A fine private school consisting of grades pre-k through 12 operates on the campus.
                  MMS teachers with advanced degrees teach several college courses to MMS students. There are 40+ staff
                  members. All students
                  from kindergarten through high school are computer literate and all high school students are computer
                  competent. <br>
                  More than 95%of MMS graduates fo on to college!

                                Before moving here I gre up with my mom who was addicted to drugs.
                                I rarely attended school because she was never sober enough to take ,e . At MMS I feel
                                safe because I know the poeple here really care about me. I am able to go to school and

                                I grew up in family of seven kids in a really bad part of louisville. It was a very hard
                                time
                                for us, especially when my little siter was diagnosed with Slickle Cell Anemia. I don't
                                thik
                                my mom was handling it all well, because she started drinking. My dad was just sad most
                                of
                                the time <br>
                                I kept wondering where God was in al of this. <br>
                                My mom went to rehag and all of us kids were sent to fifferent places. I was put into
                                foster
                                care.
                                Later on throughout my life, God turned my life around. God gave me a chance to go to
                                summer
                                camp. The director knew
                                about MOuntain Mission School and suggested it for me since things were not good back at
                                home.
                                <br>
                                I like it here. I can get all the help I need. I don't have to stress about home. I can

                                on my

                                brought me to Mountain Mission school. <br>
                                It is a whole lot better here than I imagined it would be. The food is really
                                good, and I have learned about Jesus and how He watches over me.
                                When I grow up. I want to go to college and then into the Air Force so I can protect
                                people.

                                Right now, I am here at MMS, but that's OK because it is a very beautiul and safe place.

                                I started playing trumpet just a year ago, not long before I moved to MMS. I want to be
                                a musician when I grow up and worship the Lord with my trumpet. I love Psalm 150 because
                                it talks about praising the Lord with my trumpet. <br>
                                Soccer is my favorite sport, but I love basketball, too. I never played basketball

                                coming to MMS. I'm still learning English, but my favorite subject is Math. I like MMS
                                because it is a good school and I get time to play and practice my trumpet. <br>
                                My dad always told me to help two or more people when I grow up. MMS is helping me do

                                    Sometimes Mountain Mission provides children from intact families oportunities that would otherwise be unattainable. Daniel was from an impoverished family in Portugal that had little hope of offering their son an education or a future. For Danie, basketball camp proved to be the bridge between Portugal and Virginia.

                                    "I went to an NBA camp, and I think I got the attention of the president and vice-president of the camp. They said Mountain Mission School in America would be the best school for me"

                                    Here at MMS, Daniel's skills advanced so much that he is the first MMS student ever to sign a nation letter of intent for a Division I school. He'll be attending Valparaiso University in Indiana this fall on basketball scholarship, and this summer will be returning to Portugal to complete on the national team in the Portuguese Basketball Federation.

                                  Mountain Mission has provided Daniel the educational opportunity that were beyond the reach of his family in Portugal, enabling him to discover his strengths in tecnical studies, and giving him new direction. "I want to play professional basketball, but if I don't , I'd like to go into Mechanical Engineering."

                                  Asked what he has liked best about MMS, Daniel has a quick reply. "The studies, everything All the techers help you. If you need something, they come to you individually and explain it to you. I never had anything like that in Portugal."

                                and loved by them.
                                They believed in me even when I didn't believe in myself. They have inspired me to make
                                a difference and pay it forward
                                into the lives of others. <br>

                                    Seventy years after Jimmy's arrival(see story below), Mountain Mission still offers a home to children in tragic circumstances. Just a few months ago, little two year-old Mulki came to our door in a situation not unlike Jimmy's. Her mother had died during childbirth, and her father was having difficulty raising Mulki and her brother. The father, a refugee from Africa, had a job, but it was far from his home, and childcare was a constant struggle.

                                    Without a family he could turn to for help- and after exhausting the assistance from local agencies - the father extended a heartfelt plea to Mountain Mission: "I am in a trubled situation. I request that Mountain Mission School see my situation, my problem, to understand and help me and the children. I want them to grow up at the school. I need emergency help". 
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    Mountain Mission was able to answer his cry , and today, Mulki and her brother have the safe,stable environment her father so desperately desired for his children.

                                    Mountain Mission is the only home some children have ever known. Taht was true for Jimmy Hooker, Who arrived at Mountain Mission when tragedy struck his family.

                                    "I was brought to Mountain Mission after my mother died in 1942," Jimmy recalls. " I was four years old. There were threee of us: my two sisters were six and eight. My father couldn't take care of alll of us agrer we lost our mother, so I lived here all the time until I went into the Air Force. It's been home... it's stil home. That's why I always say I come from Mountain Misson School." 
                                  </p>

                                    Now retired, Jimmy looks back on his years at Mountain Mission and sees the enduring benefits it brought to his life.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    "For me, Mountain Mission taught me how to work, how to make a living, how to be respectful... and they taught me about the Lord Jesus Christ. You couldn't ask for anybody to teach you anything better than that-to love the Lord and be a part of His Kingdom. They gabe me direction in life, and that's what they're doing for the kids here now."
